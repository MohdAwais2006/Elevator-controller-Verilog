## 🖥️ Project Overview
The Elevator Controller:
- Handles **basic floor movement logic**  
- Demonstrates **sequential circuit design** in Verilog  
- Validates correctness with a testbench and waveform outputs  

This project serves as a **beginner-level digital system design practice** and can be extended to add more functionality.
